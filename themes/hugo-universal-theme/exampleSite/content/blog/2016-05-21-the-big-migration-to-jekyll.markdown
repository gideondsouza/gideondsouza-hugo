title: The Big migration to Jekyll

So finally after all the obsession, reading and nail-biting I made the long awaited move to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/); a static blog aware site generator.

This site used to run on [Orchard](http://www.orchardproject.net/), an impressive asp.net-mvc CMS. I used it for years
right from it's inception. After a year though on the linux world I slowly had to let go of a lot of MS's stuff. I will
still always have a great relationship with C# though :)

So, on to Jekyll. Guess there's not too much I can add that's already out there. I can dish tips and dispell myths though:

* Don't get too overwhelmed, migrating any site is difficult.
* See the docs, especially the [permalinks](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/) section so your URL's stay the same.
* Free and paid themes both exist : http://jekyllthemes.org/ http://themes.jekyllrc.org/
  The theme usually will usually be site you see, and you'll have to hack your way chaging it up. This isn't so bad, especially when github hosts your site with a custom domain for free : https://pages.github.com/
* It's all about simplicity with Jekyll, that's what I love the most. [Plugins exist](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/), my theme supports the tag plugin I use from [here](http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/)

### Questions about setup?

I had a few bumps and unknowns before making the move, I'd like to unvite anyone with questions to ask them in the comments and I'd be happy to answer them.
